# Core Tools & Technologies:

Python: For data processing, model training, and live prediction (scikit-learn, pandas).

Streamlit: To host a user-friendly web interface for predictions.

SQL Server (Express): As the central data warehouse for student scores and prediction results.

Power BI: To create interactive dashboards and highlight anomalies.

# AI Integration:

The machine learning model is the intelligence core of the system.

Predicts probability of malpractice based on score disparities.

Detects outliers and suspicious patterns using historical trends.

# Impact:

Enables data-driven interventions before final exams.

Assists educators in identifying students who may need support or are relying on unethical practices.

Helps improve the credibility of internal assessments.

# Open-Source & Accessible Design:
This project uses only free or low-barrier tools, making it replicable for schools and institutions across Nigeria and beyond with limited resources.

# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a practical, AI-centered approach to solving a real educational challenge using open-source tools and showcases how data and AI can strengthen educational integrity.
